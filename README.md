## Getting Started

If you would like to run the API locally on your machine, follow the installation procedures below. Once set up, developers can explore the API endpoints, authenticate users, and start integrating task management functionalities seamlessly into their applications.
<br>

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1 **Node.js**: Make sure Node.js is installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current). <br>
2 **pnpm (Perfomant Node Package Manager)**: Fast, disk space efficient package manager. Install pnpm globally by running **`npm install -g pnpm`** in your terminal/command prompt and verify pnpm by running **`pnpm -v`**. or refer to pnpm's installation guide from [pnpm.io](https://pnpm.io/installation).
3 **GitHub Account**: Create or log in to your GitHub account to access the xcixtask API repository. <br>
4 **Docker**: If you prefer running the API within a Docker container, install Docker Desktop or Docker Engine according to your operating system from [docker](docker.com/get-started).

    Authentication (if applicable): If the deployed API requires authentication, ensure you have the necessary credentials (API key, access token, etc.) to include in your requests.

    Explore Endpoints: Refer to the API Documentation for detailed information on available endpoints, request parameters, and response formats.

Example Request:

Here's an example using cURL to create a new task on the deployed API:

bash

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Task Title", "description": "Task Description"}' https://your-deployed-api-url.com/tasks

Note:

    Ensure that you replace https://your-deployed-api-url.com with the actual URL of your deployed API.
    If there are any specific headers, authentication tokens, or additional configurations required to access the deployed API, provide these details in this section.
